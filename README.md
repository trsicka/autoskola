# HOW TO

## ENV variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
PUBLIC_SERVER_HOST=http://localhost:5000
```

The port should be the same as on the backend server.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
